# HTML5 Video Sample

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/caraya/pen/FckCd](https://codepen.io/caraya/pen/FckCd).

Taking a video file it uses HTML5 to serve cross platform video with captions for those browsers that support them. It is also the basis for what I hope to submit to html5rocks

The code is released under the MIT license. All I ask is that you let me know you're using it. It does good to the ego ;-)
